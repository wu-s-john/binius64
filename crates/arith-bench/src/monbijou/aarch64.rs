//! Direct aarch64 `PMULL`-accelerated multiplication for the Monbijou field and its extensions.
//!
//! Monbijou elements are represented with the `poly64x2_t` underlier (a SIMD vector, so the
//! multiply stays in NEON registers across call boundaries), matching the [`ghash::aarch64`]
//! module. The `PMULL` / `PMULL2` instructions (`vmull_p64` / `vmull_high_p64`) drive both the
//! carryless multiplies and the modular reduction: the high limb is folded down by carrylessly
//! multiplying it with the reduction polynomial's tail `0x1B` (`X^64 ≡ X^4 + X^3 + X + 1`), the
//! same strategy the generic [`OpsClmul`](crate::underlier::OpsClmul) path uses. Everything stays
//! in NEON registers, and the two 64-bit lanes are reduced in parallel.
//!
//! Each multiply is split into a widening half (`mul_wide*`, producing the unreduced products) and
//! a reduction (`reduce*`). Both halves are exposed because the reduction is F2-linear, so an inner
//! product may XOR-accumulate the widening products and reduce once at the very end instead of per
//! term — the same delayed-reduction structure as the `x86_64` module.
//!
