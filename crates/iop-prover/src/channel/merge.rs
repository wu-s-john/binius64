/// # Overview
///
/// An interaction round is the run of oracles sent between two challenge samples.
///
/// Committing each oracle separately costs one commitment per oracle.
/// One Merkle tree per oracle, for example.
///
/// This decorator buffers a round's oracles instead.
/// It commits them together as one larger oracle.
/// That cuts the cost to one commitment per round.
///
/// A round's oracles are sorted from largest to smallest, then laid out end to end.
/// That ordering makes every oracle's position exact.
///
/// Every earlier oracle is at least as large as the current one.
/// So their combined space is a whole multiple of the current oracle's size.
///
/// A round of a single oracle needs no combining.
/// It is forwarded unchanged, at zero cost.
///
/// A round is masked as a whole, never partly.
///
/// So a round carrying any witness data is masked in full by the underlying channel.
/// The verifier-side decorator is where that choice is made.
///
/// # Timing
///
/// A round's oracles are committed the moment a challenge is sampled.
/// Not the moment they arrive.
///
/// A real Fiat-Shamir transcript works the same way.
/// A challenge can only be derived after its commitments are absorbed.
/// So committing cannot wait past the sample that follows a round.
///
/// # Opening
///
/// A verifier only ever holds a formula for a transparent polynomial.
///
/// This side holds the actual coefficients instead.
/// A constituent's own transparent polynomial becomes one for the combined oracle.
/// Write its values into a zero buffer, at the constituent's own position.
/// Every other position stays zero.
///
/// That placement is the same polynomial a verifier reaches by formula.
/// One side holds it as explicit values.
/// The other evaluates it on demand.
