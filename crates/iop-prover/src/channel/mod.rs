/// Channel for IOP provers that extends the IP prover channel with oracle operations.
///
/// In an IOP, the prover can:
/// 1. Send field elements to the verifier via `send_*` methods (inherited)
/// 2. Sample random challenges via `sample` (inherited)
/// 3. Commit oracles to the verifier
/// 4. Respond to oracle queries with opening proofs
///
/// # Contract
///
/// The caller must call `send_oracle()` exactly `remaining_oracle_specs().len()` times before
/// calling `prove_oracle_relation()`. Each oracle buffer must match the corresponding
/// specification. Every committed oracle must be handed back to the channel exactly once with
/// `finalize_oracle()`.

	///
	/// This slice shrinks as oracles are committed via `send_oracle()`.

	/// # Preconditions
	///
	/// * `remaining_oracle_specs()` must be non-empty.
	/// * `buffer.log_len()` must match the expected length from the next oracle spec.

	/// Generates an opening proof for one oracle linear relation.
	///
	/// The relation asserts that `<oracle_poly, transparent> = claim`. An oracle may carry any
	/// number of relations.
	///
	/// The channel owns the transparent multilinear until the opening runs, so it is drawn from
	/// the caller's allocator `A` — a pooled buffer stays pooled all the way through the opening.
	///
	/// # Preconditions
	///
	/// * `remaining_oracle_specs()` must be empty (all oracles committed).
	/// * `oracle` must be a valid handle returned by `send_oracle()`.
	/// * `transparent.log_len()` must match the oracle's message length.
	/// * The claim must already be bound to the transcript, since the coefficient that batches the
	///   queued relations is drawn only after the queue closes.

	/// Gives ownership of the oracle buffer to the channel.
	///
	/// The [`Self::send_oracle`] method takes a borrowed reference to an oracle buffer and returns
	/// a handle to it. In order to prove the oracle relations without unnecessarily cloning the
	/// buffer, some channel implementations require ownership of the buffer.
	///
	/// # Preconditions
	///
	/// * `oracle` must be a valid handle returned by `send_oracle()`, not already finalized.
	/// * `buffer` must equal the buffer previously committed via `send_oracle()`.
