//! That a pooled prover stops going to the global allocator for its large buffers.
//!
//! Covers the two buffers a BaseFold prover allocates per committed oracle: the Merkle tree's
//! nodes, and the Reed-Solomon codeword.
//!
//! Wall-clock is the wrong instrument for either: the saving is a handful of large allocations
//! against work dominated by hashing and NTTs, well inside the run-to-run spread of a loaded
//! machine. The count of large global allocations is the same fact measured exactly, and it does
//! not depend on how busy the box is.
//!
//! This is an integration test rather than a unit test because it installs a
//! `#[global_allocator]`, which is a whole-binary choice.
