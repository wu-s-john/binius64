//! M4 proof of a batch of XMSS verifications, each dispatched to a chip.
//!
//! The companion to `prove_hash_primitives`, one level up: that file proves a batch of bare
//! primitives, this one proves whole signature verifications — the encoding, the 42 Winternitz
//! chains, the leaf and the 32-level authentication path, once per signer.
//!
//! The circuit is two chips deep. The main circuit holds no hash gates at all: it declares the
//! statement — the message, the epoch and every signer's public key — witnesses the signatures, and
//! dispatches one call per signer to the XMSS chip. That chip in turn reaches `blake3_compress_2x`
//! through the paired chain steps as a chip of its own. So each verification's constraints are
//! stated once and the trace pays for them once per instance, at both levels.
//!
//! The proof runs inside a timing span. With tracing enabled, the prover's internal spans nest
//! beneath that span, so the per-phase breakdown of proving is visible.
//!
//! The run exists to be read rather than to gate anything, so it is `#[ignore]`d and needs
//! `--ignored` to run. Run it `--release` as well: an unoptimized prover over this circuit is
//! slower by orders of magnitude.
//!
//! Run it with the timing tree. Signing, witness generation and proving all parallelize across
//! Rayon's worker threads by default; set `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` to read single-threaded times
//! instead:
//!
//! ```text
//! RUST_LOG=debug cargo test --release -p binius-m4-prover --test prove_hash_based_sig \
//!     -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
