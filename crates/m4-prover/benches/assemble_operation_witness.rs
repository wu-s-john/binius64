// Copyright 2026 The Binius Developers
//! Benchmark for assembling a batched per-operation witness — the operand-column layout an
//! operation reduction consumes.
//!
//! This targets [`OperandColumns::build`] at the BitAnd arity, the shape the M4 prover builds from
//! a constraint system's AND constraints. Two fixtures share the benchmark group:
//!
//! * `bitand_keccak_f1600` assembles the real AND constraints of a Keccak-f1600 permutation circuit
//!   (see the `keccak_witness_gen` bench). Operand density, shift mix and wire locality are
//!   whatever the frontend emits, so this is the production-shaped measurement.
//! * The `*_terms` cases assemble synthetic operands of a controlled term density, which a fixed
//!   circuit cannot vary. They read the same table over and over from uniformly drawn rows, with
//!   none of the locality a circuit's program order gives, so their per-word rate is pessimistic.
//!   Read them against each other rather than against the Keccak case.
//!
//! Populating the batch tables and preparing the constants and constraints are setup; only the
//! column assembly is timed, over 8192 instances.
