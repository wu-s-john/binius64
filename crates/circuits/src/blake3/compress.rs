//! BLAKE3 compression primitive.
//!
//! A BLAKE3 block is 64 bytes (16 × 32-bit words). The compression function mixes an
//! 8-word chaining value with a 16-word message block, a 64-bit block counter, a byte
//! count, and a flags word, producing an updated 8-word chaining value.
//!
//! The structure mirrors the [reference implementation] from the BLAKE3 crate.
//!
//! Every gadget here fills both 32-bit lanes of a word. Where two compressions are available they
//! run side by side, one per lane ([`blake3_compress_2x`], [`blake3_compress_2x_seq`]); a lone
//! compression splits its own round sequence across the lanes instead ([`blake3_compress`]).
//!

///
/// - `cv`: 8 chaining-value words (32-bit each, stored in the low 32 bits of each wire).

/// - `counter`: the 64-bit block counter. Low 32 bits are `t_low`, high 32 are `t_high`. The wire
///   may carry either a genuinely-64-bit counter (multi-chunk) or a 32-bit value with zero high
///   half (single-chunk).
