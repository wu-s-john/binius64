//! BLAKE2s hash function circuit.
//!
//! BLAKE2s is a cryptographic hash function optimized for 32-bit platforms.
//!
//! It produces digests from 1 to 32 bytes.
//!
//! This implementation follows RFC 7693.
//!
//! It supports fixed-length messages with unkeyed hashing.
//!
//! ## RFC 7693 compliance
//!
//! This implementation is fully compliant with RFC 7693 for the core BLAKE2s-256 hash function.
//!
//! The compression function, the G mixing function, and the message scheduling all match the
//! specification.
//!
//! ## Excluded features
//!
//! This circuit intentionally excludes the following optional features from RFC 7693:
//!
//! - Keyed hashing, also called MAC mode: only unkeyed hash verification is supported.
//! - The 8-byte salt field.
//! - The 8-byte personalization field.
//! - Tree hashing mode: only sequential mode is supported.
//! - Runtime-variable message length: the length is fixed at circuit construction time instead.
//! - Variable output length: the digest is fixed at 256 bits.
//! - Messages of 4 GiB or more.
//!
//! The high half of the byte counter is always the zero constant, which caps the supported
//! message length at just under 4 GiB.
//!
//! These exclusions suit a circuit whose job is hash verification, rather than
//! general-purpose hashing.
//!
//! # Algorithm overview
//!
//! BLAKE2s processes a message in 64-byte blocks.
//!
//! Each block goes through a compression function built from a modified ChaCha cipher core.
//!
//! A compression runs ten mixing rounds, and each round mixes the internal state with the
//! message block through eight calls to the G mixing function.
//!
//! # Circuit design
//!
//! This circuit verifies that a message of a fixed, compile-time-known length produces a
//! specific BLAKE2s digest.
//!
//! Blocks chain sequentially: each one's input state is the previous one's output.
//!
//! So consecutive blocks are compressed two at a time, packing both compressions into the two
//! 32-bit lanes of one parallel core.
//!
//! A trailing block with no partner runs through the same paired core with its second lane
//! left dead, except when the whole message is a single block, which stays fully single-lane.
