//! XMSS signature verification.
//!
//! The scheme is the one leanVM-b's `xmss` crate implements. Every parameter, every tweak and
//! every step of verification is the same, so a signature is the same construction:
//!
//! - a Winternitz one-time signature over [`V`] chains of length [`CHAIN_LENGTH`], with a
//!   target-sum encoding and no checksum chains,
//! - whose chain ends hash into a Merkle leaf,
//! - which an authentication path links to the committed root.
//!
//! The tweakable hash under it is the one thing that differs, and differs twice over: BLAKE3
//! rather than BLAKE2s, keyed rather than prefixed. The reference hashes the byte string
//! `tweak | pp | payload`; here `pp | tweak` is the BLAKE3 key and the payload is the whole
//! message. The two are 32 bytes together, exactly a key, so the domain fits it with nothing left
//! to pad. Digests therefore do not agree with the reference's — the schemes are the same, the
//! instantiations are not.
//!
//! Keying also takes the domain out of the payload, which is what makes the message encoding one
//! compression rather than two. A native verification is a constant 143:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1 (encoding) + 99 (chains, fixed by the target sum) + 11 (leaf) + 32 (path) = 143
//! ```
//!
//! In circuit the chain work is not the 99 steps a verifier walks but every one of the
//! `V * (CHAIN_LENGTH - 1) = 294`: each step's tweak is a circuit constant, so a chain has to
//! evaluate all of its steps and take the hashed value only past its digit. The target sum buys
//! encoding validity here rather than verifier work.
//!
//! Those 294 run two chains to a core, as the two 32-bit lanes of one paired BLAKE3 compression,
//! so they cost 147 cores beside the 44 lone compressions of the encoding, the leaf and the path.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Sign a message and verify it, out of circuit:
//!
//! ```
//! use binius_circuits::hash_based_sig::{MESSAGE_LEN, xmss};
//! use rand::{Rng, SeedableRng, rngs::StdRng};
//!
//! let mut rng = StdRng::seed_from_u64(0);
//! let mut message = [0u8; MESSAGE_LEN];
//! rng.fill_bytes(&mut message);
//!
//! let epoch = 42;
//! let (public_key, signature) = xmss::generate_signature(&mut rng, &message, epoch);
//! xmss::xmss_verify(&public_key, &message, &signature, epoch).unwrap();
//!
//! // The same signature at any other epoch is not a signature.
//! assert!(xmss::xmss_verify(&public_key, &message, &signature, epoch + 1).is_err());
//! ```
//!
//! [`xmss::circuit_xmss_verify`] is the in-circuit form of that check, and
//! [`aggregate::circuit_xmss_multisig`] runs it for several signers over one message.
//!
