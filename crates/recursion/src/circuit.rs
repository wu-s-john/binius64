// Copyright 2026 The Binius Developers

//! The circuit that verifies a Binius64 proof, built once per inner shape.
//!
//! ```text
//!   inner shape      ->  build    ->  circuit
//!   circuit + proof  ->  witness  ->  values that satisfy it
//! ```
//!
//! A shape is everything the protocol fixes before any proof exists: the constraint system, the
//! FRI parameters, the oracle specs. No length in the protocol depends on a received value, so
//! one circuit verifies every proof of that shape.
//!
//! [`RecursiveCircuit::build`] therefore reads a [`Verifier`] and never a proof.
//! A proof is needed only to fill a witness.
//!
//! # Going deeper
//!
//! What `build` returns is an ordinary circuit, so it has an ordinary [`Verifier`].
//! Building again over that verifier is one level deeper.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Verifier(inner) -> build -> circuit_1 -> Verifier(circuit_1) -> build -> circuit_2
//! ```
//!
//! What a level costs depends on how it settles the inner wiring claim.
//!
//! Evaluating the claim as constraints walks every inner constraint.
//! A level then costs about fifteen times the level below, and the tower diverges.
//!
//! Putting the claim on public wires instead leaves it unchecked.
//! The claim is logarithmic in the inner system, so the cost proportional to it disappears.
//! A level then costs under six times the level below.
//!
//! Deferring moves work rather than removing it.
//! Whoever holds the outer proof owes the check.
//! Nothing anywhere verifies the claim unless that check runs.
