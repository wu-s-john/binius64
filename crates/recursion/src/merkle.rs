//! In-circuit verification of a binary Merkle commitment over 128-bit field elements.
//!
//! A recursive circuit re-checks the openings a native prover produced.
//! So these gadgets reproduce the committing scheme's hash rules exactly.
//!
//! - A leaf is hashed with a full padded SHA-256 over its elements, sixteen bytes each.
//! - An inner node is one raw block compression over the 64 bytes of its two child digests.
//! - That compression starts from a domain-separating state, not SHA-256's own.
//!
//! # Element convention
//!
//! An element rides on two wires, low half first.
//! The low wire carries its serialized bytes 0 to 7 and the high wire its bytes 8 to 15.
//! Each half is read little-endian, so the pair is the element's 128-bit value split in two.
//!
//! # Digest convention
//!
//! A digest rides on four wires, in the form a block compression consumes.
//! Wire `j` carries the two big-endian message words covering digest bytes `8j` to `8j + 8`:
//!
//! ```text
//!     bits  0..32 :  big-endian u32 of digest bytes 8j     .. 8j + 4
//!     bits 32..64 :  big-endian u32 of digest bytes 8j + 4 .. 8j + 8
//! ```
//!
//! Two properties make this the cheap choice, and both explain the unusual byte order.
//!
//! - A node's 64-byte message block is then pure rewiring off its children's wires.
//! - A leaf digest lands in it for free, since SHA-256 emits its state big-endian.
//!
//! Only an inner node's output needs a conversion.
//! The native compression serializes its state *little*-endian, so each output word reverses.
//!
//! Two helpers here turn a digest or an element into the wire values a witness must carry.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Counts below are AND and BMUL constraints as the frontend compiles them.
//! Every one is pinned by this module's tests.
//!
//! The Zero column is left out of them, and it is not empty.
//! Assertions and linear definitions compile into it rather than into AND.
//! The wiring evaluation walks Zero constraints in the same sum as the BitAnd ones.
//! So they are not free to the outer proof this gadget compiles into.
//!
//! The two columns are not priced alike.
//! A Zero constraint carries one operand array to that walk where an AND carries three.
//! So they combine at `AND + ZERO / 3`, and adding them at par overcharges Zero threefold.
//!
//! An AND count is a budget for the AND reduction, not a proxy for the shift reduction.
//! The layer-depth arithmetic below is still safe, though not because it compares AND to AND.
//! Zero tracks AND at roughly 28% on both sides of that trade, a climbed level and a fold node.
//! Its break-even therefore lands within rounding of the AND column's, and picks the same depth.
//! These ratios are measured rather than pinned, unlike every figure in the table.
//!
//! One block compression is 364 AND constraints.
//!
//! A gate costs one constraint whatever its width.
//! A compression already spends both 32-bit lanes of every gate, on its own two halves.
//! So a second compression sharing that core costs exactly what it would cost alone.
//!
//! What sharing still saves is the work around the compression, paid once instead of twice.
//! That is why a bare node costs the same either way, while a leaf and a climbed level do not.
//!
//! Every place that hashes independent values still takes this route:
//!
//! - folding a layer of digests up to the root above it
//! - hashing the leaves of a whole committed vector
//! - climbing two openings' authentication paths in step
//!
//! A climb is sequential, so an opening cannot share cores with itself.
//! Two openings can, since the queries are independent, which is what the last of those does.
//! An odd query count leaves one opening climbing on its own.
//!
//! | what is measured                        | AND           | BMUL          |
//! | --------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
//! | a one-element leaf digest               | 372           | 0             |
//! | a sixteen-element leaf digest           | 1948          | 0             |
//! | two one-element leaves sharing a core   | 707 per pair  | 0             |
//! | one inner node on its own core          | 380           | 0             |
//! | one inner node sharing a core           | 380 per node  | 0             |
//! | one node of a verified layer's fold     | 380 per node  | 0             |
//! | one climbed level of a lone opening     | 380           | 8             |
//! | one climbed level of a paired opening   | 377 per query | 8 per query   |
//! | picking the layer entry of an opening   | 0             | 4 * (2^L - 1) |
//!
//! Write `D` for the tree depth and `L` for the depth of the layer an opening climbs to.
//! One opening of a pair therefore costs
//!
//! ```text
//!     AND  = half a shared leaf digest + 377 * (D - L)
//!     BMUL = 8 * (D - L) + 4 * (2^L - 1)
//! ```
//!
//! and the layer it lands on costs `380 * (2^L - 1)` AND once, shared by every query.
//!
//! ## Choosing the layer depth
//!
//! Raising `L` by one level changes the bill per query, out of `n_q` queries, by
//!
//! ```text
//!     AND  :  -377 + 380 * 2^L / n_q
//!     BMUL :  +4 * 2^L - 8
//! ```
//!
//! The two columns behave nothing alike.
//!
//! - The AND column breaks even at `2^L = 0.99 * n_q`, which is the native rule itself.
//! - That native rule sets the layer depth to `ceil(log2(n_q))`.
//! - The BMUL column gains nothing past `L = 1`, since the entry selector grows with the layer.
//! - The climb it shortens gives back only eight selects a level, which never covers that.
//!
//! AND and BMUL fill separate constraint columns, so there is no one budget to minimise.
//! At `D = 20`, `n_q = 100` and one-element leaves, charging a BMUL like an AND:
//!
//! ```text
//!     L = 6 :  5876 AND + 364 BMUL
//!     L = 7 :  5740 AND + 612 BMUL
//!     L = 8 :  5846 AND + 1116 BMUL
//! ```
//!
//! AND still leads BMUL several times over, so the AND column decides.
//!
//! - On AND alone the cheapest choice is `L = 7`.
//! - Charging BMUL at the same rate moves it to `L = 6`.
//! - Lone climbs land in the same place, since a level costs them barely 2% more.
//! - Neither is a constant, since both track `log2(n_q)`.
//! - A different query count means re-running the arithmetic above.
//! - Which column is scarce depends on what the rest of the circuit put in each one.
