//! The proof system's Fiat-Shamir challenger, re-expressed as a circuit.
//!
//! A recursive verifier derives its own challenges instead of being handed them.
//! So it must recompute the native challenger's byte stream exactly, over wires.
//!
//! # Build-time shape, run-time bytes
//!
//! The native challenger's control flow never reads the data it hashes.
//! All of this follows from the *sequence* of operations alone:
//!
//! - buffer occupancy, and where block boundaries fall
//! - the running count of sampled bytes consumed
//! - the padding bytes and the length field
//!
//! Each of those therefore lives in an ordinary Rust field, settled while the circuit is built.
//! Only byte *values* ever reach a wire.
//!
//! Two things fall out of that split:
//!
//! - The circuit is a straight line, with no multiplexer, comparison or conditional anywhere.
//! - The bookkeeping is free, since counts and padding become constants and constants cost nothing.
//!
//! # The state machine being mirrored
//!
//! The native challenger is one SHA-256 hasher plus two halves that take turns:
//!
//! ```text
//!     observe:  bytes are appended to the hasher's input
//!     sample:   bytes are read out of a 32-byte buffer holding the latest digest
//! ```
//!
//! Four events matter, and each is reproduced here exactly.
//!
//! 1. **Construction** — the hasher is fed the digest of the empty string, which also seeds the
//!    sample buffer.
//! 2. **Buffer refill** — the hasher is finalized *and reset*, its digest fed back into the fresh
//!    hasher and also served as the next 32 sampled bytes.
//! 3. **Sample to observe** — the count of sampled bytes consumed so far is appended, little-endian
//!    in eight bytes.
//! 4. **Observe to sample** — the buffer is retired, so the next byte read forces a refill.
//!
//! An *epoch* is the span between two resets.
//! Its input always opens with the previous digest's 32 bytes, so an epoch is never empty.
//! One consequence: the first 32 bytes the sampler serves are constants, compressing nothing.
//!
//! The native observer also stages bytes in a 64-byte buffer before handing them over.
//! That staging is invisible here, for two reasons:
//!
//! - A digest depends on the concatenated input, not on how it was chunked.
//! - The staging buffer is always flushed before a finalize.
//!
//! # Wire conventions
//!
//! Everything is phrased in *stream bytes*: the sequence the native challenger absorbs, and the one
//! it hands out.
//! Two wire shapes carry them.
//!
//! ```text
//!     byte wire:  one stream byte in bits [0, 8), and bits [8, 64) must be zero
//!     word wire:  eight stream bytes little-endian, stream byte k in bits [8k, 8k + 8)
//! ```
//!
//! Little-endian is the transcript's own convention, not a choice made here.
//! A 128-bit challenge is 16 little-endian bytes and a bit sample reads four.
//! So a word wire lines up with a transcript word without any shuffling.
//!
//! SHA-256 instead consumes big-endian 32-bit words.
//! Observing a word wire therefore pays a byte reversal, while a byte wire is already in order and
//! costs nothing.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! Measured by the tests at the bottom of this module.
//!
//! | item | AND constraints |
//! |---|---|
//! | one compression core, covering two chained blocks | 728 |
//! | one observed 64-byte block, amortized | 395 |
//! | one observed word, for the byte reversal | 4 |
//! | one 128-bit challenge, refills excluded | 12 |
//! | one bit sample, refills excluded | 4 |
//! | a refill's digest masking, on top of its epoch's compressions | 8 |
//!
//! No multiplication constraints are emitted, at any size.
//!
//! Consecutive blocks of an epoch chain, so they compress in pairs.
//! One two-lane core runs both, one per 32-bit lane of a 64-bit datapath.
//!
//! A lone compression also splits itself across those two lanes, at 364 constraints.
//! So a pair costs exactly what its two blocks cost apart, and chaining buys gates, not
//! constraints.
//!
//! An epoch that observes nothing is a single block.
//! So 32 bytes of sampler output cost about 374 constraints, however they are cut into values.
