/// `From<Word> + Shr<u32>` on it rather than offering channel methods, so the operations have to be
/// available without a channel in hand — hence the [`Weak`] handle back to the builder, which is
/// the same shape `CircuitElem` uses in the Spartan wrapper.
///
/// A `Constant` folds while the circuit is built and costs nothing. The FRI query indices, which
/// arrive from `sample_bits`, are `Wire`s.
