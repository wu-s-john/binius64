//! One verifier runs over both channels and reaches the same operations in the same order.
//! The circuit the first produced is satisfied by the witness the second filled, and that
//! circuit is then proved and verified like any other.
//!
//! Everything the verifier reads is derived in-circuit or bound to something that is: the

//! replay still supplies is the proof itself and the statement, which is why tampering with
//! either is rejected here.
