//! A polynomial-commitment opening proved natively, then verified inside a Binius64 circuit.
//!
//! ```text
//!   prover:    native, writing one real transcript
//!   verifier:  the same code over the builder channel, emitting gates instead of checking values
//! ```
//!
//! A satisfied constraint system is then the statement "this transcript opens this claim".
//! An outer proof can check that statement, which is what makes this one step of recursion.
//!
//! # What enters the circuit
//!
//! Two things, and nothing else:
//!
//! ```text
//!   the proof      one recorded wire per value the verifier reads off the tape
//!   the statement  the evaluation point and the claim, on public wires
//! ```
//!
//! Challenges, query indices, folded values and recomputed digests are all gate outputs.
//!
//! # Build once, verify many
//!
//! Every shape the circuit depends on is settled before a proof exists.
//! The code rate, the fold arities, the oracle layout, the tree depths, the query count.
//! So one circuit serves every opening of that shape, and a test below verifies two with one.
//!
//! # The statement is observed
//!
//! The native round trip in `binius-iop-prover` hands the point and the claim out of band.
//! It can, being a unit test rather than a protocol.
//! Here both are written to the transcript, by the prover and by each verifier alike.
//!
//! That is what lets them be wires rather than build-time constants, as "build once" needs.
//! It also binds them: a proof of one statement cannot be replayed against another.
//!
//! The point is observed before the commitment, since it is known up front.
//! The claim is observed after the masking challenge.
//! It is a claim about the masked polynomial, so it does not exist until that challenge does.
