//! What the inner proof's rate costs the circuit that verifies it.
//!
//! A recursive circuit replays a verifier, and most of that replay is per query: one Merkle path
//! climbed and hashed, one coset picked out of a decommitted layer.
//!
//! So the circuit's size tracks the query count, and the rate is what sets the query count.
//!
//! ```text
//!     n_q = ceil(security_bits / -log2((1 + rate) / 2))
//! ```
//!
//! At 96 bits that is 232 queries at rate 1/2 and 106 at rate 1/16.
//!
//! Lowering the rate pulls two ways at once, which is why this measures rather than argues.
//!
//! ```text
//!     fewer queries    ->  fewer paths to climb
//!     longer codeword  ->  each path one level deeper, and eventually one more oracle to open
//! ```
//!
//! Every point below is priced at one security level, with the query count derived from it.
//! So a lower rate buys fewer queries rather than less soundness.
//!
//! Only the rate moves here.
//! The fold arities under it are still chosen to minimize proof size.
//! So these numbers are a floor on what a schedule costed in constraints would find.
