/// The sumcheck rounds binding the outer shift of a sequence, against the folded oblong table.

/// The reduction's `h` factor spans 24 variables — the bit position and both shift slots — so its

/// operator ([`shift_operator_table`]) and `d` for the oblong weights,
///
/// ```text
///     eta := T[d]                                    2^15 entries
///     h(J, s_2, o_2, s_1, o_1) = T[eta(., s_2, o_2)](J, s_1, o_1)
/// ```
///
/// so `h` is reached by applying `T` to the oblong weights, taking the outer slice, and applying
/// `T` again. This stage holds `eta` and folds it as the rounds bind the outer slot; each round's
/// `h` rows are derived from the folded table, one slice at a time. Folding `eta` first and
/// applying `T` after gives the same answer as folding `h`, because `T` is linear in its weights.
///
/// # Why the outer slot binds first
///
/// Two independent reasons:
///
/// - **Correctness.** The two indicator matrices do not commute — `sra` is the obstruction, since
///   it is the one shift whose vacated positions all read a single input bit. Nesting `T` inside
///   `T` composes them in the order the slots are bound, so only binding the outer slot first
///   computes `h` rather than its transpose-order counterpart.
/// - **Cost.** The push-through is a *shift* only while the inner pair is still a cube index. Under
///   the opposite order the outer indicator would arrive folded to a dense `2^6 x 2^6` matrix, and
///   each live shift quadruple would cost a matrix-vector product in place of a shift.
