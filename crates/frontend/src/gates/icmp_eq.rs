//! 64-bit equality test that returns an MSB-bool indicating equality.
//!
//! Returns a wire whose value, as an MSB-bool, is true if `x == y` and false otherwise.
//! It is undefined what the NON-most-significant bits of the output wire will be.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! The gate exploits the property that when adding `all-1` to a value:
//! - If the value is 0: `0 + all-1 = all-1` with no carry out (MSB of cout = 0)
//! - If the value is non-zero: `value + all-1` wraps around with carry out (MSB of cout = 1)
//!
//! 1. Compute `diff = x ⊕ y` (which is 0 iff x == y)
//! 2. Compute carry bits `cout` from `diff + all-1` using the constraint: `(x ⊕ y ⊕ cin) ∧ (all-1 ⊕
//!    cin) = cin ⊕ cout` where `cin = cout << 1`
//! 3. The MSB of `cout` indicates the comparison result:
//!    - MSB = 0: no carry out, meaning `diff = 0`, so `x == y`
//!    - MSB = 1: carry out occurred, meaning `diff ≠ 0`, so `x ≠ y`
//! 4. Negate the MSB: `out_wire ≔ cout ⊕ 0x8000000000000000`.
//!
//! we do this in a slightly more roundabout way, in order to make things work with the builder.
//! since `out_wire` and `cout` will differ only in their MSB, it's valid to take
//! `cin ≔ out_wire << 1`, instead of `cin ≔ cout << 1`. thus, we never materialize cout.
//! in the one place we need it, we inline the expression `out_wire ⊕ 0x8000000000000000` instead.
//!
//! of course, in theory, we could have instead done out_wire ≔ cout ⊕ 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
//! this still would have been correct, as far as the MSB of `out_wire` was concerned.
//! the problem with doing that is that we then would have had to put `cin ≔ ¬out-wire << 1`.
//! doubling up on the negation and the shift caused a problem, so this works out quite nicely.
//!
//! # Constraints
//!
//! The gate generates one AND constraint:
//! 1. Carry propagation: `(x ⊕ y ⊕ cin) ∧ (all-1 ⊕ cin) = cin ⊕ cout`
