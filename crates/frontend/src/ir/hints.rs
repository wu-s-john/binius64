/// Each implementor declares a globally unique name, and the registry keys on the hash of that
/// name alone.
///
/// Every gate using the same hint type therefore shares one handler entry.
///
/// A hint's fields are not part of its identity.
/// Only the first value registered under a name is kept; later values are dropped.
/// Gates that differ only in those fields fold together under deduplication.
/// Parameterize a hint through its dimensions, never through its fields.
///
/// # The `dimensions` parameter
///
/// Both [`shape`](Hint::shape) and [`execute`](Hint::execute) take a `dimensions: &[usize]`
/// slice. This is hint-defined parameterization for a single gate — the values the caller
/// passes when invoking the hint via
/// [`CircuitBuilder::call_hint`](crate::builder::CircuitBuilder::call_hint). The same slice
/// is then handed back to `execute` at witness-generation time.
///
/// `dimensions` controls input/output arity: `shape(dimensions) -> (n_in, n_out)` tells the
/// builder how many wires the gate consumes and produces, and `execute` is later called with
/// `inputs.len() == n_in` and `outputs.len() == n_out`. A hint whose arity is fixed
/// (e.g. always 4 inputs / 6 outputs) takes an empty slice and ignores it. A hint that is
/// parameterized over, say, big-integer limb counts takes those counts as `dimensions`.
///
/// Two arity modes illustrate the contract:
/// - A parameterized hint reads limb counts from `dimensions` and derives its arity from them.
/// - A fixed-arity hint ignores `dimensions` (an empty slice) and returns a constant shape.
