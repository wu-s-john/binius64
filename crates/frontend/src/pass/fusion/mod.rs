//! Gate fusion optimization.
//!
//! The main cost of our system is coming from the number of AND constraints. The less we have the
//! cheaper it is.
//!
//! Our AND constraints are powerful construct construct. They can handle a single AND of two XOR
//! combinations where each of the values could be shifted.
//!
//! `ConstraintBuilder` which this pass operates consists of AND, IMUL and linear constraints.
//! Linear constraints are basically are constraints that define a single wire using a XOR
//! combination and/or shifts. Since our system does not suppose standalone linear combinations a
//! wire whose definition survives has to be committed, and its definition costs a Zero constraint
//! of its own.
//!
//! BUT we have a chance of avoiding that if we manage to inline that wire into every consumer
//! constraint which means we don't have to commit that value and thus we don't spend a constraint
//! on it at all!
//!
//! A definition this pass does have to commit stays a linear constraint, carrying the inlined
//! cone as its right-hand side. Which of the two lowerings it gets is
//! [`ConstraintBuilder::build`]'s call, not this pass's.

/// How many shifts a term of the lowered constraint system may carry.

/// A [`ShiftedValueIndex`](binius_core::constraint_system::ShiftedValueIndex) names two, and the

/// Spending the second is what lets a definition be inlined where its consumers' shifts do not
/// compose — the reason two thirds of all committed definitions are committed today. It is not
/// free: the terms multiply out across the consumers, which
/// [`MAX_TERM_GROWTH`](commit_set::MAX_TERM_GROWTH) is what bounds.
///
/// Both halves of the pass read this — the commit set to decide what it may inline, and the patch
/// builder to decide what it may spell — so they cannot disagree about the budget.
