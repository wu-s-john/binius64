/// Linear Expression Graph (LeGraph) - the core data structure for gate fusion optimization.

/// This graph represents the data flow relationships between linear constraints (XOR and shift
/// operations) and their uses in non-linear constraints (AND/IMUL operations). The graph is used
/// to determine which linear constraints can be inlined into their consumers to reduce the total
/// number of AND constraints in the final circuit.
///
/// # Graph Structure
///
/// The graph consists of three types of nodes:
///
/// 1. **Linear Definition Nodes** (`LinDef`): Represent linear constraints that define a wire as an
///    XOR combination of shifted values. These are candidates for inlining.
///
/// 2. **Root Nodes**: Represent uses of linear definitions in non-linear constraints (AND/IMUL).
///    These are the sinks of the graph where inlining decisions terminate.
///
/// 3. **Opaque Nodes**: Represent wires that are not defined by linear constraints (e.g., inputs or
///    outputs of non-linear operations). These cannot be inlined.
///
/// Edges in the graph flow from producers to consumers, with each edge annotated with a shift
/// operation that describes how the producer value is transformed when used by the consumer.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```text
/// // Circuit:
/// y = a ^ b        // Linear definition
/// z = y >> 5       // Linear definition using y
/// w = z & c        // Non-linear use of z
///
/// // Graph representation:
/// [a] ──┐
///       ├─> [y = a ^ b] ──srl(5)──> [z = y >> 5] ──none──> [AND root]
/// [b] ──┘
/// ```
///
/// In this example, both `y` and `z` can potentially be inlined into the AND constraint,
/// resulting in `w = ((a ^ b) >> 5) & c` without intermediate wire commitments.
