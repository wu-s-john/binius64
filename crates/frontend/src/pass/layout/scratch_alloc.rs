//! Slot assignment for the scratch segment of the value vector.
//!
//! A value no constraint references is never committed.
//! It only has to survive from the gate that writes it to the gate that last reads it.
//! Gate fusion produces many: it inlines an operation and leaves its result uncommitted.
//!
//! Those lifetimes are short, so one slot can serve several values in turn.
//!
//! ```text
//!   gate:      0     1     2     3
//!   value a:   w-----r
//!   value b:         w-----r
//!   value c:               w-----r
//!
//!   a slot each:    a  b  c       -> 3 slots
//!   shared slots:   a  b  a       -> 2 slots, since a dies before c is written
//! ```
//!
//! The batched witness buffer holds one column per instance.
//! So every slot dropped here is saved once per instance.
//!
//! # Why this cannot change a proof
//!
//! A value in this segment appears in no constraint operand, by the definition of the segment.
//! Only the recorded length of the segment moves.
