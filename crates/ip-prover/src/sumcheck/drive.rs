//! The round-by-round driver shared by every sumcheck and MLE-check entry point.
//!
//! Both protocols run the identical round loop.
//! They differ only in which coefficient of the round polynomial is left off the wire.
//!
//! The two prover traits are unrelated, so a wrapper each adapts them to the shared loop:
//!
//! ```text
//!     a sumcheck prover  -> its wrapper  -.
//!                                          >-- one round loop
//!     an MLE-check prover -> its wrapper -'
//! ```
//!
//! A wrapper also carries the format its prover's polynomials go out in, so the two cannot be
//! crossed.
