//! Prover implementation for the sumcheck protocol.
//!
//! This module provides functionality for executing the sumcheck proving protocol,
//! which allows a prover to convince a verifier that a claimed sum over a multivariate
//! polynomial is correct through an interactive proof protocol.

/// Executes the sumcheck proving protocol for a single multivariate polynomial.
///
/// This function drives the interactive sumcheck protocol, where the prover convinces
/// a verifier that a claimed sum over a multivariate polynomial is correct. The protocol
/// proceeds in rounds, with one round per variable in the polynomial.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `prover` - An implementation of [`SumcheckProver`] that computes the polynomial evaluations
///   for each round. The prover must evaluate exactly one composition polynomial per round.
/// * `channel` - The channel for sending prover messages and sampling challenges.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns [`ProveSingleOutput`] containing:
/// - `multilinear_evals`: Final evaluations of the multilinear polynomials at the challenge point
/// - `challenges`: The verifier challenges used in each round
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the prover returns more than one composition polynomial from its `execute()` method.
///
/// # Protocol Flow
///
/// For each of the `n_vars` rounds:
/// 1. The prover computes univariate polynomial coefficients via `execute()`
/// 2. These coefficients are written to the channel
/// 3. A challenge is sampled from the channel
/// 4. The prover folds the polynomial with this challenge via `fold()`
///
/// After all rounds, `finish()` is called to obtain the final multilinear evaluations.
