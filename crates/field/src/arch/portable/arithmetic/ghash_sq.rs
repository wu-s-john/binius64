//! Portable GHASH² widening multiply: three independent GHASH multiplies over the coordinates.
//!
//! This is the strategy for targets whose widest carry-less multiply is 128 bits, where batching
//! the Karatsuba diagonal into a two-lane packed GHASH multiply buys nothing — that packed multiply
//! decomposes back into two independent 128-bit multiplies, each with its own reduction. Keeping
//! the three Karatsuba products separate instead lets the multiply-by-`X` of the irreducible
//! polynomial be applied to an *unreduced* product, which folds it into a reduction
//! that has to happen anyway: two GHASH reductions per GHASH² product rather than three.
