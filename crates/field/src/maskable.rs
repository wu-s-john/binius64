/// `Maskable<T>` keeps a chosen subset of a value's `T`-lanes and zeroes the rest, against a
/// precomputed [`Self::Mask`]. It is the high-level, underlier-free primitive behind the branchless
/// masked accumulation in the shift protocol: a mask is built once with [`make_mask`] and reused
/// across many [`select`] calls, so the per-call cost is a single bitwise AND on a binary field.
///
/// It is a parent trait of [`Field`](crate::Field) (`Maskable<Self>`, a single lane) and
/// [`PackedField`](crate::PackedField) (`Maskable<Self::Scalar>`, one entry per packed lane),
/// mirroring how [`Divisible`] is a parent trait of both.

/// [`select`]: Maskable::select

	/// Builds a mask from per-lane boolean selectors, in LSB-to-MSB lane order (the same ordering

	///     .map(|(val, selected)| if selected { val } else { <zero> }))

	/// unselected lane all-zeros, so this is a single bitwise AND.
