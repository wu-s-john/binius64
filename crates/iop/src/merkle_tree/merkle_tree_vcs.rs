	/// * `len` - the length of the committed vector
	/// * `n_queries` - the number of opening queries
	/// * `layer_depth` - the depth of the internal layer the verifier decommits once and verifies
	///   all openings against (see [`Self::optimal_verify_layer`])
	///
	/// ## Preconditions
	///
	/// * `len` must be a power of two.
	/// * `layer_depth` must be at most `log2(len)`.

	///
	/// ## Preconditions
	///
	/// * `batch_size` must be non-zero.
	/// * `data.len()` must be a multiple of `batch_size`.
	/// * `data.len() / batch_size` must be a non-zero power of two.

	///
	/// When a protocol requires verification of many openings at independent and randomly sampled
	/// indices, it is more efficient for the verifier to verifier an internal layer once, then
	/// verify all openings with respect to that layer.
	///
	/// ## Preconditions
	///
	/// * `layer_digests.len()` must equal `2^layer_depth`.
