/// See [DP24], Def. 3.6 and Lemma 3.9 for more details.
///
/// NB: This method is on a hot path and does not perform any allocations or
/// precondition checks.
///
/// ## Arguments
///
/// * `math` - the NTT instance, used to look up the twiddle values.
/// * `log_len` - the binary logarithm of the code length.
/// * `chunk_index` - the index of the chunk, of size $2^n$, in the full codeword.
/// * `values` - mutable slice of values to fold, modified in place.
/// * `challenges` - the sequence of folding challenges, with length $n$.
///
/// ## Pre-conditions
///
/// - `challenges.len() <= log_len`.
/// - `log_len <= math.log_domain_size()`, so that the NTT domain is large enough.
/// - `values.len() == 1 << challenges.len()`.
///
