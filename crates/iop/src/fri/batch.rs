/// The interactive code proximity tests used in this project (eg. FRI) commit to a codeword and
/// then interactively fold it with random challenges. This trait represents the resulting *virtual
/// oracle*: the folded codeword, whose values are not committed directly but are instead recovered
/// on demand by opening the committed oracle at the queried indices and applying the folding. An
/// implementation therefore holds a handle to the committed oracle along with the folding
/// challenges, and receives openings over a Merkle channel in order to evaluate the virtual oracle
/// at queried locations.
///
/// The oracle is parameterized by the element type `E` of the channel it is opened over, since the
/// folding challenges it holds were sampled from that channel.
