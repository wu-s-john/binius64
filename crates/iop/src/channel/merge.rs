///
/// # Overview
///
/// An interaction round is the run of oracle receipts between two challenge samples.
///
/// Committing each oracle separately costs one commitment per oracle.
/// One Merkle tree per oracle, for example.
///
/// This decorator buffers a round's oracles instead.
/// It commits them together as one larger oracle.
/// That cuts the cost to one commitment per round.
///
/// # Merging
///
/// A round's oracles are sorted from largest to smallest.
/// They are laid out end to end.
///
/// Every oracle's size is a power of two.
/// Write the sizes as `2^n_1, 2^n_2, ..., 2^n_k`.
/// Sort them so `n_1 >= n_2 >= ... >= n_k`.
///
/// The combined oracle's size is `2^N`.
/// `N` is the smallest exponent that covers the total.
///
/// ```text
/// combined oracle, size 2^N:
///
///     [ oracle 1 (2^n_1) | oracle 2 (2^n_2) | ... | oracle k (2^n_k) | unused padding ]
///       offset 0           offset 2^n_1                                total size 2^N
/// ```
///
/// Sorting largest to smallest makes this layout exact.
///
/// Every earlier oracle is at least as large as the current one.
/// So their combined space is a whole multiple of the current oracle's size.
/// The current oracle therefore starts on a boundary of its own size.
/// Its position is then a whole number of its-own-size blocks.
/// That whole number is its block index.
///
/// A round of a single oracle needs no combining.
/// It is forwarded unchanged, at zero cost.
///
/// A round is witness-dependent as soon as any of its oracles is.
///
/// A commitment is masked as a whole, never partly.
/// So a structural oracle sharing a round with a witness-carrying one is masked too.
///
/// # Timing
///
/// A round's oracles are committed the moment a challenge is sampled.
/// Not the moment they arrive.
///
/// A real Fiat-Shamir transcript works the same way.
/// A challenge can only be derived after its commitments are absorbed.
/// So committing cannot wait past the sample that follows a round.
///
/// # Opening
///
/// A constituent oracle's claim is an inner product.
/// It pairs the oracle's data with a transparent polynomial.
///
/// That claim becomes a claim about the combined oracle too.
/// Extend the transparent polynomial with an equality check.
/// The check is one over the constituent's own block, zero elsewhere.
///
/// ```text
/// extended transparent(x) = original transparent(low bits of x) * is_this_block(high bits of x)
/// ```
///
/// The check is zero outside the constituent's own block.
/// So the combined inner product only ever sees this oracle's own data.
/// It equals the original claim exactly.
