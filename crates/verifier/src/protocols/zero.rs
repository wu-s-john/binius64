//! The Zero reduction.
//!
//! A ZERO constraint asserts that one constraint array vanishes. Because the constraint is linear,
//! the polynomial whose vanishing is at stake is the array's oblong-multilinearization `d_hat`
//! itself, rather than a product of witness multilinears. A multilinear that vanishes on the cube
//! is the zero polynomial, so a single evaluation at a point the prover could not predict certifies
//! the constraints outright.
//!
//! The reduction therefore carries no prover message and no sumcheck round. Its whole output is the
//! claim
//!
//! ```text
//! d_hat(r_zhat_prime, rho) = 0
//! ```
//!
//! which joins the BitAnd, IntMul and BinMul claims in the batch the shift reduction consumes. The
//! shift reduction, running against the committed witness, is what certifies it: a violated ZERO
//! constraint makes the true batched evaluation differ from the claimed one, and its final check
//! fails.

/// Builds the constraint point the Zero reduction closes at.
///
/// The reduction runs directly after the BitAnd reduction and evaluates at the point that reduction
/// has just produced: `rho` is the length-`log_zero_constraints` prefix of the BitAnd sumcheck's
/// output challenges, extended by fresh challenges from `sample` when the ZERO set has more rows
/// than the AND set. The prover and verifier derive it identically, so `sample` draws the same
/// challenges at the same point in both transcripts.
///
/// `sample` stands in for the channel: the prover and verifier channel traits are unrelated, so one
/// function can only reach both through a closure.
///
/// Every coordinate of `rho` is uniform and independent — those inherited from the BitAnd sumcheck
/// are its per-round verifier challenges — so the soundness bound is plain Schwartz-Zippel on a
/// polynomial the witness commitment pinned down before the first challenge was drawn. The
/// reduction's *input* zerocheck challenges would serve too, but they open with the deterministic
/// Rijndael coordinates, which carry no randomness and would need absorbing by a separate
/// F_2-independence argument first.
///
/// Sharing the point with the BitAnd reduction is sound despite the resulting correlation: the Zero
/// bound appeals only to the marginal distribution of the challenges it consumes, which reuse
/// leaves untouched. What it does require is that every challenge be drawn after the witness is
/// committed, which the phase ordering guarantees.
