//! The constraint reduction shared by the single-instance and batched Binius64 verifiers.
//!
//! One circuit, and `2^k` instances of one circuit, reduce the same way.
//! Which of the two it is enters as [`Instances`], and its count joins every row count.
//!
//! A batch adds one step the monolithic reduction does not have:
//!
//! ```text
//! monolithic   every operand claim already sits at a common point
//! batch        each operation's claims sit at its own instance point
//!              -> one sumcheck transports them onto a shared point
//! ```
//!
//! A batch of one instance still runs that sumcheck, over no rounds.
//! It is the batched protocol either way, because its prover folds a batched witness.
