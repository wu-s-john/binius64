/// The binary field additive NTT.
///
/// A number-theoretic transform (NTT) is a linear transformation on a finite field analogous to
/// the discrete fourier transform. The version of the additive NTT we use is originally described
/// in [LCH14]. In [DP24] Section 4.1, the authors present the LCH additive NTT algorithm in a way
/// that makes apparent its compatibility with the FRI proximity test. Throughout the
/// documentation, we will refer to the notation used in [DP24].
///
/// The additive NTT is parameterized by a binary field $K$ and $\mathbb{F}\_2$-linear subspace. We
/// write $\beta_0, \ldots, \beta_{\ell-1}$ for the ordered basis elements of the subspace. The
/// basis determines a novel polynomial basis and an evaluation domain. In the forward direction,
/// the additive NTT transforms a vector of polynomial coefficients, with respect to the novel
/// polynomial basis, into a vector of their evaluations over the evaluation domain. The inverse
/// transformation interpolates polynomial values over the domain into novel polynomial basis
/// coefficients.
///
/// An [`AdditiveNTT`] implementation with a maximum domain dimension of $\ell$ can be applied on
/// a sequence of $\ell + 1$ evaluation domains of sizes $2^0, \ldots, 2^\ell$. These are the
/// domains $S^{(\ell)}, S^{(\ell - 1)}, \ldots, S^{(0)}$ defined in [DP24] Section 4.
///
/// The methods [`Self::forward_transform`] and [`Self::inverse_transform`] take three parameters:
/// a `data` buffer with length `2^log_len`, `skip_early`, and `skip_late`. The number of total NTT
/// layers is considered to be `log_len`. "Early" layers at the beginning of the forward transform
/// or "late" layers at the end of the forward transform may be skipped. The NTT uses
/// $S^{(\ell - n)}$ for the evaluation domain for an $n$-layer NTT. (Remember, the novel polynomial
/// basis is itself parameterized by the evaluation domain.) Counterintuitively, the space
/// $S^{(n+1)}$ is not necessarily a subset of $S^{(n)}$**. We choose this behavior for the
/// [`AdditiveNTT`] trait because it facilitates compatibility with FRI when batching proximity
/// tests for codewords of different dimensions.
