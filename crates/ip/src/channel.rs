//! Channel abstraction for public-coin interactive protocol verifiers.
//!
//! In a public-coin interactive protocol, the verifier's messages consist entirely of random
//! challenges, while the prover sends deterministic messages based on the protocol state.
//! This module provides the [`IPVerifierChannel`] trait that models the verifier's view of such
//! an interaction.
//!
//! The trait abstracts over:
//! - Receiving prover messages (field elements)
//! - Sampling random challenges (which, in the Fiat-Shamir transform, are derived deterministically
//!   from the transcript)
//!
//! This abstraction allows protocol implementations to be generic over the underlying
//! communication mechanism, whether it's an actual interactive channel or a non-interactive
//! transcript using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic.
//!
//! [`WordIPVerifierChannel`] extends it for protocols that also carry 64-bit words, such as a
//! constraint system's public inputs or a code proximity test's query indices.

/// In a public-coin protocol, the verifier only sends random challenges (no secret information),
/// so the verifier's role is to:
/// 1. Receive field elements from the prover via `recv_*` methods
/// 2. Sample random challenges via `sample`
///
/// When used with a Fiat-Shamir transcript, the challenges are derived deterministically from
/// the transcript state, making the protocol non-interactive.

	/// computation, or when several such claims are better checked at once.
	///
	/// The caller MUST check what it receives here. Nothing else does.
	///
	/// A claim is a function of public-channel-derived values alone, so it carries nothing about
