/// Reduces evaluation claims on one multilinear at several points to one claim at one point.
///
/// Every claim names the same multilinear.
/// So what comes back names it too, at a point none of them chose.
///
/// ```text
///     k claims at k points  ->  one claim at one point
/// ```
///
/// The claim that comes out has the same shape as the ones that went in.
/// So a caller may reduce again.
///
/// That is what lets an aggregation node carry one claim, however many it received.
///
/// # The reduction
///
/// An evaluation is a sum over the multilinear's own index space.
/// Its weight is an equality indicator at the point.
///
/// Batching the claims weights that sum by a combination of indicators.
/// That is a plain degree-two sumcheck.
///
/// So this is the batched sumcheck plus one reconstruction, and not a protocol of its own.
///
/// A single value comes off the channel: the multilinear's evaluation at the reduced point.
/// Every claim shares it, since every claim is about the same multilinear.
/// The verifier derives each indicator itself.
///
/// # Soundness
///
/// Suppose any claim given here is false.
/// Then the claim returned is false too, except with negligible probability.
///
/// For `k` claims over `n` variables that bound is about `(k - 1 + 3n) / |F|`.
///
/// Three terms make it up:
///
/// - the batching challenge,
/// - the sumcheck itself, at degree two,
/// - the chance the combined indicator vanishes where the sumcheck lands.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if the sumcheck fails, or if the reconstruction does not hold.
///
/// The reconstruction is asserted over the channel rather than compared.
/// So it becomes a constraint on a channel that carries wires.
/// That is what lets this run inside a circuit.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if no claim is given, or if the claims do not all span the same number of variables.
