/// Verification composes the AND-check, the shift reduction, and the ring-switching opening on

///
/// 1. The AND-check verifies `A & B == C` over all rows, yielding operand claims at a row point.
/// 2. That point's low coordinates are the instance index `r_rho`, its high coordinates `r_x`.
/// 3. The shift reduction reduces the operand claims to one evaluation of the folded witness.
/// 4. The public-input consistency check ties in the shared constants.
/// 5. The ring-switch opens the committed trace at `r_j || r_rho || r_y`, matching that claim.
///
/// When the circuit has IMUL constraints the IntMul check verifies too.
/// It yields per-bit operand claims at its own instance point, distinct from the AND-check's.
/// A batched multilinear-evaluation sumcheck unifies both onto one shared `r_rho`.
/// Both operand claims at that point then feed the shift.
