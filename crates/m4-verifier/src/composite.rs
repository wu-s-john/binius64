/// The main chip runs once, so it is verified by the Binius64 verifier: its inout values are the
/// statement, known to the verifier and not committed. Each numbered chip runs once per call that
/// reaches it, so it is verified by this crate's data-parallel [`IOPVerifier`] over a batch of
/// instances, with its inout values committed alongside the private ones.
///
/// The sub-proofs share one channel, and so one Fiat-Shamir transcript and one combined FRI
/// opening. They are otherwise independent: no claim crosses between them.
///
/// ## What a composite proof does not prove
///
/// Chip calls are unconstrained. A proof therefore establishes that main's constraints hold and
/// that each chip's constraints hold on its own committed instances — it does *not* establish that
/// the instances are the ones main's calls asked for, nor that they were called at all.
/// [`ConstraintSystemM4::verify`] checks strictly more than this argument does. Constraining chip
/// calls is future work.
